kernel-cross-headers.x86_64 : Header files for the Linux kernel for use by cross-glibc
kernel-debug-core.x86_64 : The Linux kernel compiled with extra debugging enabled
kernel-headers.x86_64 : Header files for the Linux kernel for use by glibc
kernel-tools.x86_64 : Assortment of tools for the Linux kernel
kernel-tools-libs-devel.x86_64 : Assortment of tools for the Linux kernel

The closest equivalent would probably be to install the below packages:

sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel
However, if you don't care about exact equivalence and are ok with pulling in a lot of packages you can install all the development tools and libraries with the below command.

sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"

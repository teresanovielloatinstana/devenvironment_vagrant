-> To start the image fedora34 and produce a brand new Vagran file
vagrant init generic/fedora34  

output:
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.  
  
// You can modify Vagrantfile  

-> [NOT WORKING IN MY WS TERMINAL]To start with the Vagrant file in this directory, run:  
vagrant init  
  
-> To run the virtual machine described by your Vagrant file, run:  
vagrant up  
  
-> Boot with debug option:  
vagrant up --debug  
  
-> To ssh to the virtual machine running after 'vagrant up' command, run:  
vagrant ssh
Note: be careful about rm -rf /, since Vagrant shares a directory at /vagrant with the directory on the host containing your Vagrantfile, and this can delete all those files.
  
-> Stop the machine that Vagrant is managing and remove all the resources created during the machine-creation process:  
[literally: stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine]  
vagrant detroy  
  
-> List your box files:  
vagrant box list
  
-> Remove a specific box:  
vagrant box remove generic/fedora34 --box-version 3.3.2  
  
-> Gracefully stop the running vm:  
vagrant halt  
  
-> Reload a vm, to refresh provision:  
vagrant reload --provision
